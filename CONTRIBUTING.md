# Contributing to Low End

Thanks for helping! Low End is a small, free app for musicians. Bug reports, translations and code are all welcome.

## Reporting a problem or an idea

Open an issue at https://github.com/luigir86/low-end/issues. For tuner problems, say which phone you use, which instrument and note, and whether you used the phone's microphone or an external one.

## Changing the code

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and fork the repository. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) explains how the app is built.
2. Make your change on a new branch.
3. Before opening a pull request, run:

   ```
   dart format lib test
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```

4. Open a pull request explaining what changes for the player. If it changes what is on screen, update the user guides ([docs/user-guide.md](docs/user-guide.md) and [docs/manuale-utente.md](docs/manuale-utente.md)) and the texts in `lib/l10n/` too.

Keep the app light: please discuss in an issue before adding a new package, and avoid anything that tracks users or needs the internet.

## Look and feel

All colours, shapes and text styles live in `lib/app/theme.dart` and `lib/app/style.dart`: the bronze accent of the icon on ebony (the app is always dark, with no theme to choose; see [docs/tema-bronzo.md](docs/tema-bronzo.md), in Italian), and the tuner verdict colours. [docs/style.md](docs/style.md) is the style sheet: sizes, shapes and the layout of the three sections. Screens take them from the theme (`Theme.of(context)`, `LowEndColors.of(context)`) and never write a colour of their own. If you change the background colours, change `android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` too: `test/theme_test.dart` checks they match.

## Accessibility

Every screen must work with TalkBack/VoiceOver, with the largest text size and without relying on colour alone. `test/accessibility_test.dart` checks touch targets, labels and contrast: add new screens to it.

## Translations

Texts live in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` (English, the reference) and `lib/l10n/app_it.arb` (Italian). To add a language, copy `app_en.arb` to `app_<code>.arb`, translate the values and run `flutter gen-l10n`.

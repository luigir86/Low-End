# The web app (for iPhone and computers)

Low End also runs in a browser, from the same code as the Android app. On an iPhone it is added to the Home Screen and opens full screen, like an app, with no App Store. It is published for free on GitHub Pages:

**https://luigir86.github.io/low-end/**

The Android app stays the main one: the web app has the same three sections, but an iPhone does not let a web page do everything an app can (see *Limits*).

## Installing it

- **iPhone or iPad:** open the address in **Safari**, tap *Share* (the square with the arrow), then *Add to Home Screen*. Safari 16.4 (iOS 16.4) or later.
- **Android, Windows, Mac:** open it in Chrome or Edge; it works at once, and *Install app* in the browser's menu puts it among the apps.

The files are then kept on the phone: from the second opening it starts fast and works with no network. The very first opening reloads itself once, a moment after it appears, so that the sound is steady from the start (see *Sound* below). A new version arrives by itself and is used from the opening after.

## Limits

| | Android app | Web app on iPhone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sound with the screen locked or in another app | Yes, with the media notification | No: iOS pauses the page's sound |
| Media notification, headphone buttons | Yes | No |
| Stops when the headphones come out | Yes | No |
| Beat light in time over Bluetooth | Yes (`AudioRoute`) | As far as the browser knows: the light waits for the delay the browser gives for its own sound (`SpeakerAudioRoute`) |
| Silent switch | Ignored (media volume) | Ignored too, with Safari's audio session (`web_audio_session.dart`) |
| Microphone permission | Asked once | iOS may ask again, even at every opening |
| "Open settings" after a no to the microphone | Yes | No: the message says where to allow it |
| Keeps the screen on | Yes | Yes, from iOS 18.4 for an app on the Home Screen |
| First opening | Instant | A few seconds (3.5 to 4 MB), then fast |
| Action links | `lowend://action/...` | `https://luigir86.github.io/low-end/#/action/...` |

## How it works

Nothing is a second app: `web/` holds the page, its icons (made by `tool/make_icons_test.dart`) and the start-up script, and a few classes have a web version.

- **Sound.** flutter_soloud ships the same engine compiled to WebAssembly. It has two builds: one mixes on its own thread (an AudioWorklet) and needs the page to be *cross-origin isolated*, the other mixes on the page's thread, where a slow frame can make it crackle. GitHub Pages cannot send the two headers isolation needs (COOP and COEP), so our service worker adds them. On the very first opening the worker only starts once the page is up: the page then reloads itself once, under the worker, unless a sound or the microphone has already started (`web/flutter_bootstrap.js`). So the steady build is used from the start, and the other only if the player touches play in that first moment.
- **Starting fast.** `web/flutter_bootstrap.js` loads the audio engine only after the first frame, so the dial appears without waiting for it; a sound asked for before then loads it at once (`lib/audio/web_audio_engine.dart`). The service worker keeps only the drawing engine this browser uses (Flutter ships three, 37 MB together) and none of the audio engine's spare build.
- **Heavy work.** The piano's loops and the held tone are made in an isolate on the phone; a page has none, so `offThread` (`lib/audio/off_thread.dart`) makes them on the page's thread there.
- **Microphone.** The `record` package listens through the browser (getUserMedia) and gives the tuner the same 16 kHz samples, with automatic gain, echo cancelling and noise suppression switched off.
- **Where the sound goes.** `SpeakerAudioRoute` stands in for `AndroidAudioRoute`; `MediaNotificationAudio` does nothing on the web.
- **Links.** On the web the page address carries the action after `#`: `…/low-end/#/action/drone_play?note=A`. `LowEndApp` runs it as on Android, with the same rules, and puts the address back to the plain one so that a reload does not run it again.
- **Accessibility.** Flutter shows a web page to screen readers only when asked: `main.dart` asks at start.
- **No network after the first opening.** Everything comes from the site, nothing from Google's servers (`--no-web-resources-cdn`, `canvasKitBaseUrl` in `web/flutter_bootstrap.js`). `tool/web_offline.dart` writes `sw.js`, the service worker that keeps the files on the phone, and adds the COOP and COEP headers.

## Building and publishing

`.github/workflows/web.yml` builds and publishes the web app on every push to `main`. It needs GitHub Pages switched on once: *Settings › Pages › Build and deployment › Source: GitHub Actions*.

To build it by hand:

```
flutter build web --release --no-web-resources-cdn --base-href /low-end/
dart run tool/web_offline.dart build/web
```

To try it on the computer, `flutter run -d chrome` (no service worker, no isolation) or serve `build/web` under `/low-end/`.

## Trying it on an iPhone

Only a real iPhone tells how the web app sounds there; a Windows PC has no Safari. Things to check, in Safari and from the Home Screen:

1. The metronome at 80, 160 and 240: are the clicks even? Does it crackle when the screen changes (swiping between sections)?
2. With the silent switch on: is the click heard?
3. Harmony: how long does the first chord take? Do chords change on the beat?
4. Tuner: does it read a low E (41 Hz) and a high note? Does iOS ask for the microphone at every opening?
5. Lock the screen while it plays, then come back: does the sound start again when touched?
6. Close it, turn on airplane mode, open it again: does it start?
